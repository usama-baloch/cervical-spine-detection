# cervical-spine-detection

# Worked on dicom format data, images Fractural images were given in dicom format. Moreover, Fractures can be more difficult to detect on imaging due to superimposed degenerative disease and osteoporosis. I designed a CNN classifierto identify fractures based on the CT Scan images of Cervical Spine (neck).Used Tiling to partition the images into mini-batches to detect small fractures. Used Transfer Learning to Fine-tune an Efficient-Netb07 model, achieving 0.54 on the Log Loss metric. Ranked Top 8% in Kaggle Competition.
